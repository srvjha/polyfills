// In machine coding polyfill is one of the most asked questions

/*
What is polyfill ?
--> Any prototype method which is desgined by browser can have different pros and cons based on the type of browser like chrome,safari and internet explorer
so it is quite possible that some of them may not support these built in methods or they doesnt exists for particular prototype so what they do is they create their own version of this method so incase if the built doesnt exist or works it uses their version so that the code execution doesnts stop that is what called as polyfill
